# investment

The most recent code is "two_types.ipynb".
It needs tickers to input (I take them from SPb exchange website in their format ListingSecurityList.csv)
Then after running all the cells we get 2 tables "boost.xlsx" and "growth.xlsx".
The first one is about small-cap fast growing companies with relatively high risk.
The second one is obout large growing companies with relatively low risk.
All the companies inside are sorted ba so called "Score" value. The more - the better.
The investing decision still ramains with every investor.
